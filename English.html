         <p class="font text-center">The Bushwick Community Map is a mapping project that will provide local residents and community organizers with housing and urban planning data of our neighborhood to help track the changes happening in Bushwick, particularly the urban vices of gentrification and displacement.</p>

   <div class="container text font">
	   <h1>WHY?</h1>
	   <P>Bushwick is in a housing justice crisis. Across Bushwick, as housing investors buy homes and raise rents to line their pockets, they kick out longstanding low-income tenants, either through illegal intimidation tactics or questionably “legal” tactics in the housing court system. Many tenants know little about how to stand up and fight against this injustice, knowing very little about their home: who their landlord is, if their unit is rent-stabilized, how many code violations are filed on their building, and more. While most tenants know that change is happening, they often can't see the the widespread nature of the change across their neighborhood. Additionally, community organizers working to help prevent displacement need a more precise sense of the trends occurring on particular blocks, buildings, and across the neighborhood to know where to focus their efforts.</P>

<P>While real estate agents and investors use costly websites to search for homes to buy, quickly gathering information to expand their portfolio and increase profits from rents in Bushwick and New York City wide, we saw the need for a free, community-owned, and community-directed map to help residents get a better sense of these changes and to unite together against these injustices.</p>
	</div>

   <div id="how-does-it-work" class="container text font">
	   <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
	   <p>The Bushwick Community Map functions as a community map displaying city and housing data including PLUTO tax information, landlord/ownership, recent building constructions, recent job filings for renovations, DOB violations, zoning, available FAR, and other data. While there are already other city-data websites out there — such as the Oasis Map and the City’s GIS map — this map will sort through all available databases to present the information most relevant to general community members and organizers in an easy-to-understand format.</p> 

		<p>Besides displaying public data, it will provide a way for community members to share their stories and point out places at risk.</p>

	   <h1>ABOUT</h1>

<p>This Map and Database Project are a development of North West Bushwick Community Group's partnership with Michael Ziggy Mintz (email him at ziggy@elephant-bird.net). The Community Group's call for data and resources to be accessible in a targeted and refined way led to this project's undertaking and will contribute to its continued development.</p>

<p>Bushwick residents active in NWB felt caught off guard and underprepared to engage in complex discussions and decisions around land use and housing. At the same time NWB and local Residents desired to organize targeted campaigns and pragmatic structures in opposition to the unwelcome market pressures and displacement in our community. </p>

<p>NWB's engagement in ULURP and investigation of Bushwick's housing climate lead us to understand a need to track our housing stock and land use changes. We desire to identify, map, and gauge our housing/land use vulnerabilities and our strengths. </p>

<p>Our NWB working goals include empowering community through targeted access to information, engaging residents in public processes, and to provide tools for communities organizing for housing affordability, community stability, and advocating for local need in development conversations. We look to the potential for participatory data sets to further engage community and track changes public data does not currently successfully record.</p>

<div class="container text font end">
	<h1>Hopefull Developments of this map</h1>

	<p><strong>Participatory Data Sets:</strong> to encourage public engagement and contribute to the trackability of local changes in housing, resident communities, and land use. This would be an “informative” map and website documenting the major developments and sites of gentrification in Bushwick, focusing on the human stories behind the data. It will ‘tell the story’ of the changes in Bushwick and complement the more data-oriented map. The data solicited from map-users, residents,and ex-residents, will be potentially framed to help track changes and vulnerabilities through data collection not done successfully by city agencies.</p>

	<p><strong>Data on Proposed New Developments:</strong> a “what’s next” map. This will be continually updated with proposed new buildings and zoning changes for Bushwick, so community members and organizers won’t be surprised by a new development.</p>
